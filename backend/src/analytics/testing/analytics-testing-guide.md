# Analytics & Admin Dashboard Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the complete analytics integration from backend event recording to frontend dashboard display.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Backend Setup
- Ensure NestJS backend is running on `http://localhost:3001` (or your configured port)
- Database connection is established (PostgreSQL with Prisma)
- Analytics module is properly registered in `app.module.ts`

### 2. Frontend Setup  
- Ensure Next.js frontend is running on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
- API client is configured to connect to backend
- React Query is set up properly

### 3. Required Dependencies
Make sure these packages are installed:

**Backend:**
```bash
npm install @prisma/client prisma class-validator class-transformer @nestjs/swagger
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query recharts date-fns lucide-react sonner
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Database Schema Testing

**Check Prisma Schema:**
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

**Verify Tables Created:**
- `AnalyticsEvent`
- `AdminReport` 
- `ModelUsageLog`
- Check that all enums are created: `AnalyticsEventType`, `AdminReportType`

### 2. Backend API Testing

**Start Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

**Test Analytics Endpoints:**

1. **Dashboard Overview** (requires admin role):
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/analytics/dashboard/overview" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>"
   ```

2. **Usage Analytics:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/analytics/usage?interval=daily&limit=10" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>"
   ```

3. **Revenue Analytics:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/analytics/revenue?interval=daily" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>"
   ```

4. **Top Users:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/analytics/top-users?limit=5" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>"
   ```

5. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/analytics/health" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>"
   ```

**Expected Responses:**
- All endpoints should return `200 OK`
- Response format should match the DTOs defined
- Mock data should be generated if no real events exist

### 3. Event Recording Testing

**Manual Event Recording:**
1. **Recipe Generation Event:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/analytics/events" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>" \
     -d '{
       "eventType": "RECIPE_GENERATION",
       "metadata": {
         "recipeId": "test-recipe-123",
         "ingredients": ["tomato", "cheese"],
         "processingTime": 1500
       }
     }'
   ```

2. **Community Post Event:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/analytics/events" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>" \
     -d '{
       "eventType": "COMMUNITY_POST", 
       "metadata": {
         "postId": "test-post-456",
         "recipeId": "test-recipe-123"
       }
     }'
   ```

**Verify Events in Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM "AnalyticsEvent" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Frontend Testing

**Start Frontend Server:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Test Admin Authentication:**

1. **Access Protection:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`
   - Should redirect to login if not authenticated
   - Should show access denied if user is not admin

2. **Admin Login:**
   - Log in with an admin user account
   - Should be able to access `/admin/dashboard`

**Test Dashboard Components:**

1. **Overview Cards:**
   - Should display total users, revenue, recipes, videos, etc.
   - Cards should show loading skeleton initially
   - Data should populate from API calls

2. **Analytics Charts:**
   - Should display usage trends line chart
   - Should display revenue area chart  
   - Should display subscription bar chart
   - Should display AI cost trends
   - Charts should respond to interval changes (daily/weekly/monthly)

3. **Data Tables:**
   - Should display top users table with ranking
   - Should display trending recipes table
   - Tables should support search functionality
   - Export buttons should download CSV files

4. **Real-time Features:**
   - Should auto-refresh every 2 minutes
   - Refresh button should work manually
   - Real-time metrics alert should show current activity

### 5. Integration Testing

**Complete Flow Test:**

1. **Generate Events:**
   - Use your existing frontend to generate recipes
   - Create community posts and interactions
   - Make subscription purchases

2. **Verify Event Recording:**
   - Check that events are recorded in the database
   - Verify event metadata is captured correctly

3. **Check Dashboard Updates:**
   - Navigate to admin dashboard
   - Verify that new events show up in analytics
   - Check that charts update with new data
   - Verify top users and trending recipes reflect activity

### 6. Export & Report Testing

**Export Testing:**
1. Use export dropdown in admin dashboard
2. Select different data types (usage, revenue, subscriptions, AI costs)
3. Verify CSV files download with correct data

**Report Generation Testing:**
1. Use report generation dropdown
2. Generate daily/weekly/monthly reports
3. Check that reports are created and status updates

### 7. Error Handling Testing

**Test Error Scenarios:**

1. **Invalid Authentication:**
   - Access endpoints without JWT token
   - Use expired tokens
   - Use non-admin tokens for admin endpoints

2. **Invalid Data:**
   - Send malformed event data
   - Use invalid enum values
   - Send requests with missing required fields

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Test with backend offline
   - Test with slow network connections
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly

### 8. Performance Testing

**Load Testing:**

1. **Event Volume:**
   - Create many events in quick succession
   - Verify database can handle high volume
   - Check API response times

2. **Dashboard Performance:**
   - Test with large datasets
   - Verify charts render efficiently
   - Check memory usage in browser
